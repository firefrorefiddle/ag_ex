Using SCF and MCF we were able to solve most problem instances of up to 30 nodes.
However SCF was able still to solve one instance with 60 nodes. Nonetheless,
those with 60, 90, 120 or 180 nodes were out of reach.
Compared to two other algorithms, MTZ showed a rather poor performance and
it came up with some results in reasonable time only for the smallest
instances with 10 nodes. Although SCF and MCF seem very similar in comparison
of their results, SCF tends to perform slightly better.

Finally, there seems to be a long way to traverse toward optimizing the
implementation of these algorithms provided that applying them on a real application domain is
desired.
