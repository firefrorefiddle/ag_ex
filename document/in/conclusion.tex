Using SCF and MCF we were able to solve most problem instances of up to 30 nodes. SCF could also solve one instance with 60 nodes. Otherwise, those with 60, 90, 120 or 180 nodes were out of reach.
MTZ fared very poorly and comparison and only gave results in reasonable time for the very smallest instances (10 nodes). SCF and MCF seemed about equal in comparison, with SCF tending to perform slightly better.
