Moving toward the ultimate goal of finding an optimal solution for the problem
stated before, the first step is to formulate this problem is a way solvable by
integer programming. Subsequently these formulae can be easily structured and
implemented such that available integer programming solvers can be utilized to
find our required answer. Here as suggested by course instructors, CPLEX solver
is used to find the proper answer to a mixed integer linear program created and
formulated out of requirements of mentioned problem.

Short after formulating the problem, the implementation is given based on three
different flow control methods, single commodity flows, multi commodity flows
and Miller-Tucker-Zemlin subtour elimination constraints which are used to
eliminate subtours from our solutions.

The very first thing which is mandatory is an objective function that can be
optimized. Here it is proposed to try to minimize following function as our
objective function:

\begin{center}

\texttt{minimize }$\sum_{k = 1}^{m} \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \sum_{j = 0}^{n}
C_{ijm} X_{ijm}$

\end{center}

While $X_{ijm}$ defines connectivity between each pair of nodes $(i,j)$ in
$m-$th tour, $C_{ijm}$ brings the cost of this connection into our objective
function.

Now since the objective function is declared, so the constraint must be defined
as well. Let's start with the requirements listed before and formulate them one
by one.
