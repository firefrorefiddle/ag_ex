Following, results achieved by running the algorithms are depicted in
Table\ref{tab:results}.
Every instance is tested once with each subtour termination algorithm. Apparently the
algorithms are capable of reaching the correct answer for every instance and it
is only running time that makes it hard to get the final result for larger
inputs.
