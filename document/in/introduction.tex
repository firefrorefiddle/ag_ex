The main task which is tried to be achieved in this experiment and projectis to find an optimal solution for Time-Constrained Bipartite Vehicle RoutingProblem, known as TCBVRP hereafter which is defined by followingcharacteristics:Given an asymmetric Graph $G=(N,A)$ where the nodes $N$ comprises three kind ofnodes, demand nodes (D), supply nodes (S) and a single depot and the weight ofarcs corresponds to the travel time from their tales to their heads with maximum$m$ available vehicles, maximum $m$ tours is demanded having the lowest costamong all possible solutions. Besides, the length of each tour cannot exceed acertain amount defined by inputs.In order to find such an optimal solution there are some restrictions whichshould be taken into consideration which come following and will be referred tolater in this report.Here are these restrictions:\begin{enumerate}  \item Each demand node is visited exactly once  \item Each supply node is visited at most once  \item Each tour starts and ends at the depot  \item The first visited node in each tour is a supply node  \item The last visited node in each tour must always be a demandnode.\item Only arcs between different types of nodes are allowed\item The total time of a tour shall not exceed a threshold T\end{enumerate}Figure \ref{fig:vis} illustrates one of the input instances and allpossible connections to use\footnote{The graph is visualized by Networkx\cite{hagberg2004networkx}and PyPlot libraries in Python 2.7}. Gray $0$ node shows the depot while green nodes indicate supplynodes $S$ and red nodes present demand nodes $D$.\begin{figure}[H]  \centering    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./figures/instance1.png}      \caption{\label{fig:vis} Visualisation of the first input instance. Gray,  green and red nodes are the depot, supply nodes and demand nodes  respectively.}  \end{figure}In the next section, formulation and implementation every single one of theseconstraints is discussed and shown.
