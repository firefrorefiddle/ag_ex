In this report, it is tried to solve a problem called Time-Constrained BipartiteVehicle Routing Problem (TCBVRP) by mixed integer linear programing throughformulating and implementing in C++ for CPLEX solver and eventually a briefdescription on utilized algorithms and selected approach along withsome experimental results is presented.
